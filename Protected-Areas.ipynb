    "# Introduction\n",
    "The Biogeographic Characterization Branch of CSASL partners with many organizations to produce the official inventory of protected open space in the United States, the Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US). Working with federal, state, local, national and nongovernmental organizations, the PAD-US group assembles, checks and produces integrated information that describes public open space and other protected areas and delineates their boundaries. The resulting national inventory is an key resource for informing decisions about conservation, recreation or land use planning at different scales and across administrative boundaries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an overview of that inventory's assets and foundational data management practices. It also provides an entry point for exploring the interplay of managed lands, national conservation policy and resource management decisions. A goal of this notebook is to provide easy access to BCB data assets associated with protected areas and managed lands in general, documenting programmatic ways to quickly inventory and explore those assets, and provide code examples for working with and analyzing these data."
