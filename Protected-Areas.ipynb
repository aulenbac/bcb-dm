    "# Introduction\n",
    "The Biogeographic Characterization Branch of CSASL partners with many organizations to produce the official inventory of protected open space in the United States, the Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US). Working with federal, state, local, national and nongovernmental organizations, the PAD-US group assembles, checks and produces integrated information that describes public open space and other protected areas and delineates their boundaries. The resulting national inventory is an key resource for informing decisions about conservation, recreation or land use planning at different scales and across administrative boundaries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an overview of that inventory's assets and foundational data management practices. It also provides an entry point for exploring the interplay of managed lands, national conservation policy and resource management decisions. A goal of this notebook is to provide easy access to BCB data assets associated with protected areas and managed lands in general, documenting programmatic ways to quickly inventory and explore those assets, and provide code examples for working with and analyzing these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Management Plan Focus\n",
    "The latest iteration of this notebook has been reorganized based on the sections of the PAD-US Data Management Plan written in early 2017. We've copied sections of that text here and then looked to see if there is a way to verify the concepts or pull information that backs them up in some way using code. Ideally, we should be able to have some form of validation for everything in the DMP. In some cases, we've made notes about how some parts of the data managenent process might be looked at in a different way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sections in the notebook follow the data management lifecycle organization of the DMP. We use the \"bcb-dm\" GitHub repo where this notebook lives to create specific issues to be worked on as part of this data management planning and execution process. Issues are labeled with \"Protected Areas\" and with a name aligning with stages of the data lifecycle as shown here and used as an organizing principle. Code blocks below each major section heading in this notebook access issues for that section (using labels) with GitHub API searches and display them dynamically. "

PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database of areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural, recreational or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase maps and describes public open space and other protected areas. Most areas are public lands owned in fee; however, long-term easements, leases, and agreements or administrative designations documented in agency management plans may be included. The PAD-US database strives to be a complete “best available” inventory of protected areas (lands and waters) including data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The dataset is built in collaboration with several partners and data providers (http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/stewards/). See Supplemental Information Section of this metadata record for more information on partnerships and links to major partner organizations. As this dataset is a compilation of many data sets; data completeness, accuracy, and scale may vary. Federal and state data are generally complete, while local government and private protected area coverage is about 50% complete, and depends on data management capacity in the state. For completeness estimates by state: http://www.protectedlands.net/partners. As the federal and state data are reasonably complete; focus is shifting to completing the inventory of local gov and voluntarily provided, private protected areas. The PAD-US geodatabase contains over twenty-five attributes and four feature classes to support data management, queries, web mapping services and analyses: Marine Protected Areas (MPA), Fee, Easements and Combined. The data contained in the MPA Feature class are provided directly by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Protected Areas Center (MPA, http://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov ) tracking the National Marine Protected Areas System. The Easements feature class contains data provided directly from the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED, http://conservationeasement.us ) The MPA and Easement feature classes contain some attributes unique to the sole source databases tracking them (e.g. Easement Holder Name from NCED, Protection Level from NOAA MPA Inventory). The \"Combined\" feature class integrates all fee, easement and MPA features as the best available national inventory of protected areas in the standard PAD-US framework. In addition to geographic boundaries, PAD-US describes the protection mechanism category (e.g. fee, easement, designation, other), owner and managing agency, designation type, unit name, area, public access and state name in a suite of standardized fields. An informative set of references (i.e. Aggregator Source, GIS Source, GIS Source Date) and \"local\" or source data fields provide a transparent link between standardized PAD-US fields and information from authoritative data sources. The areas in PAD-US are also assigned conservation measures that assess management intent to permanently protect biological diversity: the nationally relevant \"GAP Status Code\" and global \"IUCN Category\" standard. A wealth of attributes facilitates a wide variety of data analyses and creates a context for data to be used at local, regional, state, national and international scales. More information about specific updates and changes to this PAD-US version can be found in the Data Quality Information section of this metadata record as well as on the PAD-US website, http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/history/.) Due to the completeness and complexity of these data, it is highly recommended to review the Supplemental Information Section of the metadata record as well as the Data Use Constraints, to better understand data partnerships as well as see tips and ideas of appropriate uses of the data and how to parse out the data that you are looking for.

The PAD-US geodatabase is required to organize and assess the management status (i.e. apply GAP Status Codes) of elements of biodiversity protection. The goal of GAP is to 'keep common species common' by identifying species and plant communities not adequately represented in existing conservation lands. Common species are those not currently threatened with extinction. By identifying their habitats, gap analysis gives land managers and policy makers the information they need to make better-informed decisions when identifying priority areas for conservation. In cooperation with UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre, GAP ensures PAD-US also supports global analyses to inform policy decisions by maintaining World Database for Protected Areas (WDPA) Site Codes and data for International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categorized protected areas in the United States. GAP seeks to increase the efficiency and accuracy of PAD-US updates by leveraging resources in protected areas data aggregation and maintenance as described in \"A Map of the Future\", published following the PAD-US Design Project (July, 2009) available at: http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/vision/ with updates coming soon. While PAD-US was originally developed to support the GAP Mission stated above, the dataset is robust and has been expanded to support the conservation, recreation and public health communities as well. Additional applications become apparent over time. See the GAP Website http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/resources/ or the companion site http://protectedlands.net/uses for more information.</td></tr><tr><th>relatedItems</th><td><table border=\"1\"><tr><th>link</th><td><table border=\"1\"><tr><th>url</th><td>https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=56bba648e4b08d617f657960</td></tr><tr><th>rel</th><td>related</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><th>id</th><td>56bba648e4b08d617f657960</td></tr><tr><th>webLinks</th><td><ul><li><table border=\"1\"><tr><th>type</th><td>Online Link</td></tr><tr><th>uri</th><td>http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/PADUS/</td></tr><tr><th>hidden</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>rel</th><td>related</td></tr></table></li><li><table border=\"1\"><tr><th>type</th><td>Online Link</td></tr><tr><th>uri</th><td>http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/PADUS</td></tr><tr><th>hidden</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>rel</th><td>related</td></tr></table></li><li><table border=\"1\"><tr><th>type</th><td>Online Link</td></tr><tr><th>uri</th><td>http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/</td></tr><tr><th>hidden</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>rel</th><td>related</td></tr></table></li><li><table border=\"1\"><tr><th>type</th><td>Online Link</td></tr><tr><th>uri</th><td>https://doi.org/10.5066/F7G73BSZ</td></tr><tr><th>hidden</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>rel</th><td>related</td></tr></table></li><li><table border=\"1\"><tr><th>type</th><td>webLink</td></tr><tr><th>uri</th><td>https://doi.org/10.5066/F7G73BSZ</td></tr><tr><th>title</th><td>The File downloads in a .zip format</td></tr><tr><th>hidden</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>rel</th><td>related</td></tr></table></li><li><table border=\"1\"><tr><th>type</th><td>webLink</td></tr><tr><th>uri</th><td>http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/PADUS</td></tr><tr><th>title</th><td>The File downloads in a .zip format</td></tr><tr><th>hidden</th><td>False</td></tr><tr><th>rel</th><td>related</td></tr></table></li><li><table border=\"1\"><tr><th>type</th><td>webLink</td></tr><tr><th>uri</th><td>https://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/PADUS1_4/Comb_Protected_Green/MapServer</td></tr><tr><th>title</th><td>PAD-US 1.4 -

    "It's not entirely clear why a list of how priorities are determined is the focus of a section on data acquisition factors. Other things that could be considered here might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Update frequency on the part of PAD-US data sources (something that could be made explicit with future dates on ScienceBase Items documenting PAD-US sources and then used in laying out update schedules for the product)\n",
    "* Identification of issues in the data by users/stakeholders needing correction (could be flagged at the metadata level for a source dataset initially or in the data themselves, allowing for dynamic reporting in something like this notebook or for work scheduling)  \n",
    "* Identification of new requirements for the system requiring evolution of the data model to accommodate new concepts/properties (depending on how we structured this work, new properties could be added to the data model and then reported on by the system in terms of process toward completion)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a focus of this section is on priority setting, we could put a mechanism in place to capture this information in a structured way. If we begin documenting PAD-US sources as discrete items in ScienceBase, we could make this type of reasoning explicit within our data management system. Some of the bullets from the DMP here are a little bit vague and could be improved with some thinking about how we designate the positioning of data sources in the priority queue. We could likely use the expedient of tags from a controlled vocabulary on items in a PAD-US sources collection to indicate how decisions are being made. In that way, we could then call up a report at any time to dynamically display prioritized lists of sources we are acquiring for PAD-US."
