# Remote Participation in Working Groups
One of the things we are experimenting with in the "bcb-dm" working groups is how people who are not physically present in the working groups can effectively participate. Dialing in to audio or following along on screen may work for some types of meetings but is perhaps not as effective or interesting for anyone involved. We'll be experimenting in these sessions with at least one member of our team who cannot be with us in person and may need to participate asynchronously with the activities of the groups.

## In GitHub

We think this can work fairly by making good use of this GitHub repo, capturing items that remote participants may be able to jump in on at their own pace. We'd like to experiment with the following features:

* Discussion thread - Jump in on any issue with comments or spawn a new issue that comes up in thinking about the problem space.
* Issue assignment - If you see an issue that looks interesting to tackle that's not assigned to someone, assign yourself, make a comment so we know what you're thinking, and do some work on it.
* Pull requests - Branch the repo to work on an issue in code and commit it back for consideration with a pull request.
* Pull request review - Notify the team or specific individuals that you've got something to consider by requesting review on a pull request.
* Project participation or creation - If you see a project start that looks interesting, see what issues are in need of work and jump on one by assigning yourself. Or if you think of a larger set of work you'd like to pursue and lead, create a project to organize a set of issues and pull requests and get to work on it.

## On Ryver

Some of us in BCB have been using Ryver for live group chat. It's a competitor to Slack with a couple of different features that we like. We've created an open forum (bcb-dm) for the working groups. The Ryver channel we are on is [https://blacksheep.ryver.com](https://blacksheep.ryver.com). Let Sky or Steve A. know if you need an invite.
